# Unruggable Protocol

The Unruggable Protocol uses a combination of unruggable contracts and decentralized governance to secure onchain data. The protocol's onchain policies govern the relationship of counterparties throughout the web3 ecosystem and are contained in books, which are governed by guardians to ensure policy integrity over time.

## Protocol Components

The Unruggable Protocol is composed of three key components: Books, Policies, and Guardians.

> ### Books
>
> A book is an onchain smart contract that contains a set of policies governing a specific aspect of the web3 ecosystem, such as domain name rentals, sports data, or macroeconomics. Books are designed to be both useful as onchain smart contracts as well as legal and practical documents. Anyone can create a book, and the policies contained within the book are enforced by the guardians.

> ### Policies
>
> Policies are a set of rules that dictate how counter parties should interact with each other within the web3 ecosystem. These policies are contained within a book and are enforced by the guardians. Policies can be a combination of onchain and offchain instructions sets, where on a day-to-day basis, the onchain aspects secure the policies, while over the long term, the guardians following the offchain policies maintain the policies.

> ### Guardians
> 
> Guardians are responsible for ensuring the integrity of the policies contained within a book over long periods of time. They are responsible for maintaining the policies in a way that is consistent with the book's rules and are required to have the necessary credentials to do so. Guardians can be individuals, organizations, or DAOs, and they are selected by the creator of the book. The guardians have the authority to modify the policies contained within a book if they see fit, but their actions should be in line with the overall purpose of the book.


## Domain Name Rental Book Example 

A domain name rental price book is a good example of a book in the protocol. This book contains a policy that sets rental prices based on conditions such as the length and type of domain name (.com, .xyz, or .eth) in a fiat currency. The policy also includes a directive to maintain the value over time. Guardians are responsible for maintaining rental prices and ensuring policy compliance, and the book contains policies, signatures, and credentials of the guardians. Books are both onchain smart contracts and practical documents.

## Open and Permissionless Protocol 

The Unruggable Protocol is an open and permissionless protocol that allows anyone to create a book. For example, a macroeconomics book could contain policies about GDP and inflation, stating where data would be sourced and how new sources could be used if previous sources become unavailable. Guardians would be responsible for maintaining the data, enabling offchain macroeconomic data to be put onchain in a trustworthy manner.

## Sports Data Book Example 

A sports data book could also be created, containing policies for player and game stats. A council of guardians would post the data according to the book's policies, allowing trusted sports data to be used in onchain applications.

## Composable Protocol

The Unruggable Protocol is fully composable, with guardians that can be larger entities such as DAOs or multisig wallets. This allows for the highest possible decentralization in governing books. Policies can be a combination of onchain and offchain instructions, with onchain aspects securing policies day-to-day while guardians following offchain policies maintain policies over the long term.

## Oracle Risk

One persistent problem in the web3 economy is the issue of outdated, faulty, or malicious oracle data. It is not possible to completely rely on oracle data long-term. The Unruggable Protocol incorporates oracle data into a policy that can be used day-to-day in the same way as an oracle. However, if the oracle dies or is manipulated, a new oracle can be found or maliciously manipulated data can be blocked.
