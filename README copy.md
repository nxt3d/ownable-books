# Unruggable Protocol

Unruggable Protocol secures onchain data using using a combination of unruggable contracts and decentralized governance. At the core of the protocol are onchain policies which govern the relationship of counter parties thoughout the web3 ecosystem. Polices are contianed in what in the protocol are called books, and books are governed by gardians who ensure the entegtiy of the policies over long periods of time. 

## Domain Name Rental Book Example 

A good example of a book might a domain name rental price book. In the book would be a policy that would set the prices of domain name rentals, based on conditions like the length of the domain name and the type of name i.e. .com, .xyz, or .eth, in a fiat currency as well as a directive that over the long term the value should stay similar to the purchasing power that it had to begin with. The gardians would be responsible to maintain the rental price, in such a way that the policy is maintained. Contained in the book would be the policies as well as signatures and credentials of the guardians. Books are designed to be both useful as onchian smart contracts as well as legal and practical documents.

## Open and Permissionless Protocol 

Unruggable Protocol is an open and permissionless protocol where anyone can create a book. Another example might be a book containing policies about macroeconomics, i.e. GDP, inflation, etc. The policies would state where the data would be sourced from and how in the future new source could be used if the previous sources of data become unavailable, and the guardians would be responsible for maintaining the data. This would enable key offchain data about macroeconomics to be put onchain in a way that is as trustworthy as the guardians who maintain the data.

## Sports Data Rental Book Example 

It would also be possible to create a book with sports data policies, for stats on players and games played. A council of guardians would be responsible for uploading the data according to the policies contianed within the book. If the guardians of the book are trusted, it would be then possible to use sports data in onchain applications. 

## Composable Protocol

Unruggable Protocol is fully composable. Gardians can be larger entites, for example DAOs or multisig wallets. It is therefore possible to govern books with the highest possible decentrlization. Policies can be a combination of onchain and offchain instructions sets, where on a day to day basis the onchian aspects secure the policies, while over the long term the guardians following the offchain policies maintain the policies. 

## Oracle Risk

One persistent problem in the web3 economy is the problem of outdataed, faulty, or malicious oracle data. It is therfore not possible to completely rely on oracle data over the long term. With Unruggable Protocol it is possible to incorporate oracle data into a policiy that on a day to day basis can be used in exactly the same way as an oracle, but in the event that the oracle dies or is manipulated it would be possibe to find a new oracle or block maliciusly manipulated oracle data.  


# Unruggable Protocol

The Unruggable Protocol uses a combination of unruggable contracts and decentralized governance to secure onchain data. The protocol's onchain policies govern the relationship of counterparties throughout the web3 ecosystem and are contained in books, which are governed by guardians to ensure policy integrity over time.

## Protocol Components

The Unruggable Protocol is composed of three key components: Books, Policies, and Guardians.

### Books

A book is an onchain smart contract that contains a set of policies governing a specific aspect of the web3 ecosystem, such as domain name rentals, sports data, or macroeconomics. Books are designed to be both useful as onchain smart contracts as well as legal and practical documents. Anyone can create a book, and the policies contained within the book are enforced by the guardians.

### Policies

Policies are a set of rules that dictate how counter parties should interact with each other within the web3 ecosystem. These policies are contained within a book and are enforced by the guardians. Policies can be a combination of onchain and offchain instructions sets, where on a day-to-day basis, the onchain aspects secure the policies, while over the long term, the guardians following the offchain policies maintain the policies.

### Guardians

Guardians are responsible for ensuring the integrity of the policies contained within a book over long periods of time. They are responsible for maintaining the policies in a way that is consistent with the book's rules and are required to have the necessary credentials to do so. Guardians can be individuals, organizations, or DAOs, and they are selected by the creator of the book. The guardians have the authority to modify the policies contained within a book if they see fit, but their actions must be in line with the overall purpose of the book.




## Domain Name Rental Book Example 

A domain name rental price book is a good example of a book in the protocol. This book contains a policy that sets rental prices based on conditions such as the length and type of domain name (.com, .xyz, or .eth) in a fiat currency. The policy also includes a directive to maintain the value over time. Guardians are responsible for maintaining rental prices and ensuring policy compliance, and the book contains policies, signatures, and credentials of the guardians. Books are both onchain smart contracts and practical documents.

## Open and Permissionless Protocol 

The Unruggable Protocol is an open and permissionless protocol that allows anyone to create a book. For example, a macroeconomics book could contain policies about GDP and inflation, stating where data would be sourced and how new sources could be used if previous sources become unavailable. Guardians would be responsible for maintaining the data, enabling offchain macroeconomic data to be put onchain in a trustworthy manner.

## Sports Data Book Example 

A sports data book could also be created, containing policies for player and game stats. A council of guardians would post the data according to the book's policies, allowing trusted sports data to be used in onchain applications.

## Composable Protocol

The Unruggable Protocol is fully composable, with guardians that can be larger entities such as DAOs or multisig wallets. This allows for the highest possible decentralization in governing books. Policies can be a combination of onchain and offchain instructions, with onchain aspects securing policies day-to-day while guardians following offchain policies maintain policies over the long term.

## Oracle Risk

One persistent problem in the web3 economy is the issue of outdated, faulty, or malicious oracle data. It is not possible to completely rely on oracle data long-term. The Unruggable Protocol incorporates oracle data into a policy that can be used day-to-day in the same way as an oracle. However, if the oracle dies or is manipulated, a new oracle can be found or maliciously manipulated data can be blocked.
